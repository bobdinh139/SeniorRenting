[Here](#Features) are some reasons why it is better than google form (traditional way).

[Set-up guide](#How-to); Want to contribute? :point_right: [Contribution guidelines](https://github.com/bobdinh139/SeniorRenting/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

More (to-do, changelog, [**_future project_**](https://github.com/bobdinh139/PROMposal) :heart_eyes: , etc) at [WIKI](https://github.com/bobdinh139/SeniorRenting/wiki).

## NOTES

Passwords in ```addsenoirname.php ``` and ``` RemoveABidd.php ``` are not encrypted for the sake of simplicity.

Verification link is _NOT_ gonna be developed, and it was removed from to-do list. Therefore, The website only sends you an email,
and you have to reply back if there is anything wrong.

In blind-bidding, you will not be able to see the current price of each senior. In addition, the minimum price for each senior will be
raised over time. This does not neccessary mean it is the current price of that senior; the actual price can be higher/lower.
