## Description 

Little project to make senior bidding activity better!

[Here](#Features) are some reasons why it is better than google form (traditional way).

[Set-up guide](#How-to)

Read more about the project (to-do list, changelog, etc) at [wiki](https://github.com/bobdinh139/SeniorRenting/wiki).

## NOTES

Passwords in ```addsenoirname.php ``` and ``` RemoveABidd.php ``` are not encrypted for the sake of simplicity.

Verification link is _NOT_ gonna be developed, and it was removed from to-do list. Therefore, The website only sends you an email,
and you have to reply back if there is anything wrong.

In the blind-bidding, you will not be able to see the current price of each senior. In addition, the minimum price for every senior will be
raised over time. This does not neccessary mean it is the current price of that senior; the actual price can be higher/lower. 

You should refresh the website frequently to check for any new bids/updates as it is written in php.
